<h1>Starting</h1>
<h2>Part 1: The idea</h2>
<p>When you start something, it is always better to know what you want to start.</p>
<p>At least a little bit.</p>
<p>Or at least what direction you want to go to.</p>
<p>My idea for this website is very simple, I would like to be able to put everything I do in a single place, because if I leave it all on my computer, I am surely going to forget a good part. </p>
<h2>Part 2: [Not implemented yet]</h2>
<p>Once you get the idea, you need to start working on an implementation of your idea.</p>
<p>I'll continue later though</p>
