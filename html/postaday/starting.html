<h1>Starting out</h1>
<p>How long do you think I will write those?</p>
<p>It's only the third day and I find it hard to find things to write about. I have a lot of topics I would like to talk about, but more in detail, they're not something I would like to write entirely in a day.</p>
<p>It'll get better though, that's why I am writing after all.</p>
<p>I would love to make it a habit.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>A bit like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ParashockX/community">poorly drawn comics by parashocx</a> which I find very inspiring and fun. (he got to 1000 recently!)</p>
<p>Anyway, we'll see</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
