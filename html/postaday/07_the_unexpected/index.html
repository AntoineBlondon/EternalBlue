<h1>The Unexpected</h1>
<p>There exists a creature whose name is The Unexpected,</p>
<p>Summoned by dark magicians since the dawn of times,</p>
<p>And when they summon it at your side, you have to work with it.</p>
<p>Today my mother chose to summon a small The Unexpected for me, nothing much, but I still would have prefered she didn't.</p>
<p>And now it is there, laying by my side.</p>
<p>I have no idea what to do with it yet so...</p>
<p>I guess I'll just start a chat.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I'll tell you how it goes</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
