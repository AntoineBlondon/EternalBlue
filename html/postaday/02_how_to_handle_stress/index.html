<h1>Stress (and how to handle it)</h1>
<p>stress is a weird thing</p>
<p>waiting for something stressful stresses you all by itself, you feel like you actively need to do something, but you can't make seconds go slower or faster.</p>
<p>so you try to pass the time by stressing more, which is not really a good idea, but in the end it's the same.</p>
<p>the stressful moment passes and you start to stress for the next one, or don't if you're lucky.</p>
<p>sometimes you just want to scream, sometimes you just want to silence yourself</p>
<p>so you take a deep breath...</p>
<p>hold...</p>
<p>and release... slowly...</p>
<p>again... and again...</p>
<p><br><br></p>
<p>you'll make it through</p>
<p>I believe in you</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
