<h1>chemistry is witchcraft</h1>
<p>maybe it's just that I did not work this subject enough, but chemistry really seems like witchcraft</p>
<p>not like cool magic that gives you sparkles in your eyes, but deep, dark magic, one you'll never understand the intricacies of.</p>
<p>Mix <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> and you'll find <strong>this</strong> specific property. Now clean everything and leave.</p>
<p>being colorblind doesn't really help too, all substances are similar, so it accentuates the weirdness</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>usually, the magic I like involves numbers (mostly ones and zeros) or doesn't involve anything other than the mind</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>still, I get it, I'm not a fan, but I get the appeal</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
