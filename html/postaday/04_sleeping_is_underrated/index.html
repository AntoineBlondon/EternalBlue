<h1>Sleeping is underrated</h1>
<p>People around me don't get how useful having a good night sleep is for anything.</p>
<p>Want to spend more quality time with your friends?
<br></p>
<p><strong>sleep more</strong></p>
<p><br>
Want to follow better in class?
<br></p>
<p><strong>sleep more</strong></p>
<p><br>
Want to not have a headache each time you wake up?
<br></p>
<p><strong>sleep more</strong></p>
<p><br>
Want to be more productive when working?
<br></p>
<p><strong>sleep more</strong></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>it's easy, just sleep more than 4 hours each night</p>
<p>I try to get 7-8h of sleep minimum and I still crave more sleep, how can you say you're fine with 5?</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>I don't get them.</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>sleep well tonight :)<br><br></p>
