<h1>Days off</h1>
<p>days off could be very nice, but we use them for catching up to the other days</p>
<p>so, it feels more like a restoration day than anything else, which is sad.</p>
<p>how amazing would it be if we could appreciate days off to their full potential?</p>
<p>maybe later, let me rest</p>
<p><br><br><br></p>
<p>See you tomorrow!</p>
<p>have a nice day :)<br><br></p>
