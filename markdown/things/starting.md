# Starting

## Part 1: The idea

When you start something, it is always better to know what you want to start.

At least a little bit.

Or at least what direction you want to go to.

My idea for this website is very simple, I would like to be able to put everything I do in a single place, because if I leave it all on my computer, I am surely going to forget a good part. 


## Part 2: [Not implemented yet]

Once you get the idea, you need to start working on an implementation of your idea.

I'll continue later though
