# The Art of Limitations

this is a small presentation I did for a public speaking school project, and I still find it quite nice, so here it is

## Limitations & Creativity

Imagine you are an artist, given only two colors to paint with. Or a chef, asked to prepare a gourmet meal with just three ingredients. These scenarios might seem daunting because of their constraints, but today, I would like to explore the art that emerges from such limitations, and the inherent creativity they demand from us.

In a world where we are often told that “more is better”, the idea of limitations may seem contrary to progress and creativity. We tend to view them as being frustrating and negative, limiting our potential. However, this perspective overlooks the elegance that arises when we embrace constraints.

What are limitations, really? They are boundaries, in resources, in capabilities, in time. Yet, history is rich with stories where constraints have not blocked innovation but infused it.
When we are cornered by limits, we are pushed to distill our thoughts into their purest forms. And in this process, we often stumble upon solutions we would never have considered otherwise.

Consider [“La disparition”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void), a novel by Georges Perec. This book offers a remarkable example of creativity born from self-imposed limitations, in fact, the author wrote the 300-page novel without once using the letter “E”. This book is a testament to human ingenuity and the potential that lies within constraints.

## The case of a special language

Now, Imagine something as essential as a language only having 120 words to express billions of ideas. This is the premise of [Toki Pona](https://tokipona.org/), a language created by a Canadian linguist. It challenges its speakers to communicate complex ideas through minimalism. You might wonder, how could one possibly discuss advanced concepts with such a limited vocabulary?

Toki Pona forces creativity in every sentence. WIth less than 2 hundred words, each sentence becomes a problem to solve. How do I express **simply** this specific thing? Context is the key. Without specific words for things, Toki Pona requires us to innovate and describe things as they appear in the context we are talking about. A ‘Computer’ might become a work tool when discussing work, or a container of cat videos when discussing entertainment. Each term doesn't just label; it narrates. The limitation enables speakers to actively use their creativity, to paint a picture with the limited palette they have.

Take the astonishing example of a Toki Pona speaker explaining non-Euclidean geometry in a 30-minute video. The speaker had to build from the ground up, using foundational concepts to bridge the audience to advanced mathematical theories, showcasing the incredible power of human ingenuity within bounds.

## This is where we find beauty

The beauty in limitations lies not merely in the end product but in the process it involves. To truly use the power of constraints, one must root themselves in the present moment. Being deeply connected to the world around us, we find ourselves more aware, more observant, and thus more capable of distilling the complex into something simple yet profound.

In Toki Pona, with a scarce amount of predefined words, the language does not dictate the speaker’s thoughts, but is shaped by them. Every individual crafts unique concepts from their personal experiences. This means each conversation is not just an exchange of ideas but a mixture of personal narratives. The beauty here is not just in what is said, but in the unspoken: the space between words filled by human experience.

And within this minimalist linguistic framework, every speaker becomes not just a communicator, but an artist of dialogue. Each sentence is a deliberate act of creativity that shares not just a message but a part of their worldview. The subjectivity of problem solving means there are as many ways to express an idea as there are speakers. Each conversation shows a fraction of the possible ways we can interpret and convey thoughts in the same set of rules.

This is the beauty of limitations. It lies in the mindful connection to the present, in the deeply personal and subjective nature of creation, and in the diversity of expression that blooms from a single seed of constraint. Through Toki Pona, we witness the emergence of a unique form of beauty; one that celebrates the ingenuity and diversity of human thought, while reminding us that sometimes, less truly is more.

I invite you, fellow students, future engineers, creators, thinkers, not to shy away from limitations. Instead, embrace them. Challenge yourselves to find beauty in simplicity, power in constraint, and profound creativity within the confines of your canvas, whatever it may be.
