# I love to make bad things

Embracing badness in all its glory

## ¿What is 'good'?

we could spend 10 thousand years defining what makes something good,

but right now I would like to write about making bad things.

## ¿What is 'bad'?

I don't mean something that is hurtful, just something of poor quality, something not really polished, maybe a bit ignorant, etc...

because the fun of spending 20 hours doing something stupid just for the sake of it gives soooo much more motivation than finishing with something good

and can be as rewarding.

last year I spent too much time implementing pokemon types inside my programming language (yes), each variable could have a type (fire, ghost...) and it would change their interactions based on if one was super effective against the other.

it was soo fun

also useless,

very stupid,

and time consuming,

<br>

but oh soo fun

<br>

10 days later I deleted all the code for these types to clean up the project.


I didn't regret any second spent.

having a stupid idea is silly enough, but actually implementing it is a blessing when you have the time:

it teaches you why your idea is stupid, but most importantly, you need to be resourceful to actually do it.

and the more bad things you do, the better you become at doing them.

<br>

next time you have a weird idea, think about how fun it could be to do and if it's possible to do without consequences, give it a second thought :)
