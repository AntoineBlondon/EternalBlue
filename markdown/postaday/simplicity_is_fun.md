# Simplicity is fun!

This website is very simple,

and I really like that.

no framework, pure markdown, HTML, CSS, a small sprinkle of python.

For now it makes the perfect website.

Complexity calls complexity, I wouldn't post simple random stuff in a highly complex environment, we don't need to focus on the responsiveness and crazy features.

Simplicity is fun!

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
