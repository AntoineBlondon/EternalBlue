# The Unexpected

There exists a creature whose name is The Unexpected,

Summoned by dark magicians since the dawn of times,

And when they summon it at your side, you have to work with it.

Today my mother chose to summon a small The Unexpected for me, nothing much, but I still would have prefered she didn't.

And now it is there, laying by my side.

I have no idea what to do with it yet so...

I guess I'll just start a chat.

<br>

I'll tell you how it goes

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
