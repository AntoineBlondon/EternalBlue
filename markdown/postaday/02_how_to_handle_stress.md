# Stress (and how to handle it)

stress is a weird thing

waiting for something stressful stresses you all by itself, you feel like you actively need to do something, but you can't make seconds go slower or faster.

so you try to pass the time by stressing more, which is not really a good idea, but in the end it's the same.

the stressful moment passes and you start to stress for the next one, or don't if you're lucky.


sometimes you just want to scream, sometimes you just want to silence yourself

so you take a deep breath...

hold...

and release... slowly...

again... and again...

<br><br>

you'll make it through

I believe in you

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
