# Debut

This marks the beginning of a daily series where I try to improve at writing things.
So I will post something everyday (that's the point) and I have no idea when it'll stop.

maybe tomorrow,

maybe in a week,

maybe next year,

who knows?

There's a good chance I will talk about my studies (2nd year engineering), but don't worry (haha I saw you there), as I'll make it a challenge to make it 'not boring' to anyone. (everything is relative though)

Maybe i'll write small ideas I have, small poems, or just random thoughts. My goal is not to make good things (as [I love making bad things](../things/bad_things)).

Anyway, I will call this series Postaday<br>
(it is very fun to say (try it!))
<br><br><br>

See you tomorrow then!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
