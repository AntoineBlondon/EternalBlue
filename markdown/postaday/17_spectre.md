# spectre!

ah ha !

I made a (very simple but quite nice) spectrogram that I put [here](../projects/spectre)

<br>

I learnt about Fourier transform some time ago and I use spectrograms basically everyday, so I though it could be nice to have my own!
I might update it with what I need in the future
(we'll see)

<br>

don't hesitate to check it out if you want!

See you next time!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
