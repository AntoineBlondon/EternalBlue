# Days off

days off could be very nice, but we use them for catching up to the other days

so, it feels more like a restoration day than anything else, which is sad.

how amazing would it be if we could appreciate days off to their full potential?

maybe later, let me rest

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
