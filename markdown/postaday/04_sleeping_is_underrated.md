# Sleeping is underrated

People around me don't get how useful having a good night sleep is for anything.

Want to spend more quality time with your friends?
<br>

**sleep more**

<br>
Want to follow better in class?
<br>

**sleep more**

<br>
Want to not have a headache each time you wake up?
<br>

**sleep more**

<br>
Want to be more productive when working?
<br>

**sleep more**

<br>

it's easy, just sleep more than 4 hours each night

I try to get 7-8h of sleep minimum and I still crave more sleep, how can you say you're fine with 5?

<br>

I don't get them.

See you tomorrow!

sleep well tonight :)<br><br>
