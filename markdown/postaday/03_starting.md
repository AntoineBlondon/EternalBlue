# Starting out

How long do you think I will write those?

It's only the third day and I find it hard to find things to write about. I have a lot of topics I would like to talk about, but more in detail, they're not something I would like to write entirely in a day.

It'll get better though, that's why I am writing after all.

I would love to make it a habit.

A bit like the [poorly drawn comics by parashocx](https://www.youtube.com/@ParashockX/community) which I find very inspiring and fun. (he got to 1000 recently!)

Anyway, we'll see

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
