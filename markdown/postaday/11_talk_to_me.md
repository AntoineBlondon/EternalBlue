# talk to me

look at me, straight in my eyes, and just talk to me

I know you want to, I know you really want to, and I do too

but you can't

at least you won't, for an obscure reason that you can overlook (and want to), but you don't

it's too difficult you think, but deep down you know you can, you are able to

with just a little push...

<br>

this teeny tiny push is too hard too, you mumble frustrated, looking at your recording of you saying it on your computer

<br>

that is enough

it's ok, take your time

maybe you'll retry when you won't expect it

<br>

Â¿who knows?



<br><br><br>

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
