# Lucid dreams

I would love to be able to lucid dream consistently

imagine: for about 15 min to 1h a day, you can experience anything, like Anything

but to be able to get lucid in dreams, you need to get lucid in real life

<br>

in a way it is beautiful, the appeciation of the dream world implies you need to spend time appreciating the waking world

you can't escape your life without spending quality time

<br>

it seems like a good habit:

- get a good sleep schedule
- notice the present moment in all its intricacies multiple times in your day


<br><br><br>

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
