# chemistry is witchcraft

maybe it's just that I did not work this subject enough, but chemistry really seems like witchcraft

not like cool magic that gives you sparkles in your eyes, but deep, dark magic, one you'll never understand the intricacies of.

Mix *this* and *that* and you'll find **this** specific property. Now clean everything and leave.

being colorblind doesn't really help too, all substances are similar, so it accentuates the weirdness

<br>

usually, the magic I like involves numbers (mostly ones and zeros) or doesn't involve anything other than the mind

<br>

still, I get it, I'm not a fan, but I get the appeal

See you tomorrow!

have a nice day :)<br><br>
